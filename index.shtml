  <h3><a name="hello" id="hello">Hello and Welcome</a></h3>
  <p>This is a personal web space which was set up to describe myself for the potential
  employers and for personal purposes. It is hosted on my own VPS, running CentOS with LAMP stack. One of my future plans includes adding the web picture gallery.</p>

  <h3><a name="about" id="about">About Me</a></h3>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve always loved travelling. No wonder that I ended up studying 2000km away
  from home &ndash; I still remember the day when my plane has first landed in Birmingham
  on September 22, 2010.</p>
  <p>This is when my story as an IT geek began.</p>
  
  <p>I open my own doors. When my peers look for a safe option, I search for challenge. When my friends
  went to universities back home in Lithuania, I travelled to study to UK, aged nineteen.
  I arrived without knowing anyone, with limited funds and made it work. By the end of my
  first year I got a job in a small town with limited employment opportunities, became
  financially independent from my parents and achieved consistent marks of 60% upwards at
  University for the assignments and exams. </p>
  
  <p>At the moment I am a Computer Science finalist at Aberystwyth University on track for a 2:1 degree with genuine passion for
  hardware and proven troubleshooting skills. I returned back to my studies in September
  after an Industrial Year that I have spent as an ICT technician in Information Services
  department of Aberystwyth University. </p>
  
  <p>My final year at University will soon come to an
  end and it will be the time to open a new door...</p>

  <p>I constructed this <a href="./cs15020/">website</a> for
  the assignment in my second year, it was written completely from scratch.</p>
